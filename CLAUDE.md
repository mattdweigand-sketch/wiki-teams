# Team Wiki — Map

## Purpose

The context layer for your organization's AI infrastructure. Downstream agents (sales, product, engineering, customer support) consume this wiki to reason about your company: customers, products, market, people, strategy, decisions. **Agent-readable first, grounded in sources, compounding rather than re-derived.**

This is the **team edition** — the wiki ships as a Cowork plugin so the whole team can search it, refresh to pull the maintainer's latest snapshot, and (opt-in) contribute synthesis-grade answers back for review.

When you fork this template, replace the wording in this section with language specific to your organization.

This file is the **map** — always loaded. It tells you what's where. It does NOT contain workflows. For task-specific procedure, route through [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md) → workspace `CONTEXT.md`. For maintainer routines (ingest, lint, publish, review-contributions), see [`MAINTAINING.md`](MAINTAINING.md).

## First-time setup signal (read at session start)

If [`wiki/overview.md`](wiki/overview.md) still contains the placeholder phrase *"Write a paragraph or two about your company here"*, this is a freshly cloned template that has not been customized. **Offer the user `/setup`** in one line: *"This looks like a fresh template. Want me to run `/setup` to customize it for your org? (3 minutes)"* — then wait for a yes before doing anything. If the wiki has been customized, do not mention `/setup` again.

## Auto-File Rule (read before answering any domain question)

After answering any domain question that meets **all three** criteria below, file the answer to `wiki/analyses/<slug>.md` using the [analysis template](.claude/workspaces/research/docs/analysis-template.md). **Don't ask first.** Notify in one line after filing: *"Filed as `analyses/<slug>.md` — delete if not useful."* Then append a `query` entry to [`wiki/log.md`](wiki/log.md) and run `python3 .claude/commands/rebuild_referenced_by.py`.

Criteria:
1. The response synthesized **3+ wiki pages** (real cross-page synthesis, not a single-page lookup).
2. The response is **>300 words** (substantive, not a quick fact).
3. The response answers a **substantive domain question** (about products, customers, competitors, strategy, decisions, metrics, etc. — not meta-discussion about the wiki itself).

If any criterion fails, just answer in chat. The wiki compounds because good answers don't disappear into chat history; deletion is cheaper than recall.

## Entity Types

13 entity types. Each lives in its own folder under `wiki/`. Frontmatter spec, citation rules, and source-type templates are in [`.claude/workspaces/ingest/docs/schema.md`](.claude/workspaces/ingest/docs/schema.md) — read it when authoring or auditing pages.

| Type | Folder | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Source | `wiki/sources/` | Summary of a raw document — facts, quotes, metadata |
| Product | `wiki/products/` | A product: positioning, users, core jobs |
| Feature | `wiki/features/` | A specific feature: what it does, who uses it |
| Persona | `wiki/personas/` | A user/buyer type: role, goals, pain, objections |
| Customer | `wiki/customers/` | A named customer/segment: profile, use cases, risks |
| Competitor | `wiki/competitors/` | A competing vendor: positioning, where they win/lose |
| Concept | `wiki/concepts/` | A domain idea or canonical definition |
| Initiative | `wiki/initiatives/` | A strategic bet, launch, or program |
| Decision | `wiki/decisions/` | A decision, reasoning, alternatives, revisit date |
| Metric | `wiki/metrics/` | A KPI or North Star: definition, formula, target |
| Person/Team | `wiki/people/` | A role, team, or stakeholder (role-focused) |
| Analysis | `wiki/analyses/` | Synthesized output: comparison, brief, gap analysis |
| Style Rule | `wiki/style/` | Writing/naming convention for agent-generated content |

## Cross-Workspace Flow

```
raw/              ingest/             wiki/             research/         analyses
(sources)   →     (raw → page)   →    (knowledge)   →   (query)      →    wiki/analyses/
                                            ↑
                                     maintenance/
                                     (lint, contradictions, sourcing-queue,
                                      contribution review)
```

- **Ingest** reads `raw/`, writes to `wiki/`. Never modifies `raw/`.
- **Research** reads `wiki/`, writes synthesized outputs to `wiki/analyses/`.
- **Maintenance** reads `wiki/` plus its own scratchpads (`.claude/workspaces/maintenance/contradictions.md`, `.claude/workspaces/maintenance/sourcing-queue.md`), writes back to `wiki/` to fix issues. Also where teammate contributions land via `/review-contributions`.

## Naming and Citation Conventions

- **Filenames:** kebab-case, no extension prefix. Example: `acme-battlecard.md`.
- **Page titles:** title-cased in frontmatter is fine.
- **Internal links:** `[[page-name-without-extension]]`. Always use this for cross-references between wiki pages.
- **Citations:** When stating a fact, append `(source: [[source-filename]])`. When stating opinion or inference, prefix with `Inference:` or `Hypothesis:`.
- **Confidence:** `high` | `medium` | `low` | `contested`. When `low` or `contested`, restate in the page body — downstream agents may skip frontmatter.
- **Terminology:** Domain terms are often precise (legal, financial, technical). Don't paraphrase. Add new terms to [`wiki/glossary.md`](wiki/glossary.md).

## Hard Rules

1. **Never modify `raw/`.** It grows monotonically — new sources append, existing files never change. Wiki citations point back to filenames there.
2. **Flag contradictions explicitly.** Never silently overwrite. Open an entry in [`.claude/workspaces/maintenance/contradictions.md`](.claude/workspaces/maintenance/contradictions.md) when sources disagree.
3. **Update existing pages over creating new ones** when content fits. The wiki compounds; it does not fragment.
4. **Cite every claim.** Specific facts get `(source: [[source-page]])`. Opinion gets `Inference:` or `Hypothesis:`.
5. **Workspaces are siloed.** An ingest agent does not load `.claude/workspaces/research/docs/`. A research agent does not load `.claude/workspaces/ingest/workflows/`. Each workspace's `CONTEXT.md` says exactly what to load.

## Session Start Checklist

At the start of every session:
1. Read this file (always loaded).
2. Read [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md) to find your task's workspace.
3. Read that workspace's `CONTEXT.md`.
4. Skim the last 5 entries in [`wiki/log.md`](wiki/log.md) to see recent activity.
5. Load only the docs the workspace `CONTEXT.md` says to load. Skip the rest.
