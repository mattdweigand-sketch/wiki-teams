# Lint Criteria

What a "lint" pass looks for. Loaded when the user says "lint the wiki."

A lint is **diagnosis, not surgery.** Report findings. The user approves fixes. Then apply.

## What to Check

### 1. Contradictions
Two or more pages making incompatible claims about the same entity. Most common forms:
- Different facts (Customer X uses Product A vs. Product B)
- Different framings (Competitor Y is "weak on payments" vs. "strong on payments")
- Different time windows treated as "current" (a stale claim hasn't been superseded)

When found: open or update an entry in [`../contradictions.md`](../contradictions.md). Update the affected pages to `confidence: contested` if not already.

### 2. Stale Claims
A claim superseded by a newer source but not yet reflected on the page.

Signals:
- The page's `updated:` is older than the most recent source it cites
- A newer source in `wiki/sources/` references the same entity
- The page makes a time-bound claim ("currently…", "as of Q2…") that has aged out

When found: propose the update. After applying, refresh the page's `updated:` date.

### 3. Orphan Pages
A page with no inbound `[[links]]` from other wiki pages. Either:
- It needs back-links added (the page is fine but no one links to it)
- It belongs in the index/glossary/overview but isn't there yet
- It's genuinely vestigial and should be merged or deleted

When found: propose adding back-links from the obvious candidates (the products it relates to, the customers it affects, the initiatives it informs). If genuinely vestigial, ask the user before deleting.

### 4. Missing Cross-References
Two pages that *should* link to each other but don't.

Patterns to check:
- Products ↔ features (every product page should link to its features; every feature should link back to its parent product)
- Customers ↔ products (each customer page links to the products they use)
- Customers ↔ personas (each customer page links to the personas involved in the buy)
- Competitors ↔ products (each competitor page names the products it competes with)
- Decisions ↔ initiatives/products/metrics (each decision links to what it affects)
- Analyses → entity pages cited (and entity pages → analyses that reference them)

The auto-generated `## Referenced by` section is rebuilt by `python ../../../commands/rebuild_referenced_by.py` — run that as part of every lint cycle to catch these mechanically.

### 5. Terminology Drift
The same concept being called by different names across pages.

Process:
- Check [`../../../../wiki/glossary.md`](../../../../wiki/glossary.md) for the canonical term.
- Find pages using non-canonical synonyms.
- Propose normalizing them (or, if a synonym is genuinely the audience-appropriate term in context, note the deprecated mapping in `glossary.md`).

Private-markets terminology is precise — carried interest, waterfall, NAV, capital call, distribution, subscription document all have specific meanings. Don't tolerate paraphrase here.

### 6. Concepts Mentioned Without Their Own Page
A page references a concept (e.g., "GP-led secondary," "NAV facility") that lacks a `wiki/concepts/<term>.md` of its own. The reader can't follow the link.

When found: propose creating the concept page. If it would be substantial enough to warrant ingestion of a source, add to [`../sourcing-queue.md`](../sourcing-queue.md) instead.

### 7. Confidence Upgrades
Pages currently marked `confidence: low` that have accumulated enough sources since their last update to upgrade to `medium` or `high`.

When found: propose the upgrade. Apply on approval.

### 8. Confidence Downgrades / `contested` Surfacing
Inverse of #7. A page marked `high` that turns out to rest on a single thin source. Or a page where the contributing sources have started disagreeing.

When found: propose the downgrade or the `contested` flag.

## Lint Report Format

Group findings by category. Cap at 10–15 top items. Order by impact (contradictions before terminology drift).

```markdown
## Lint Report — YYYY-MM-DD

### Contradictions (2 new, 1 unresolved)
- [[customer-acme]] vs. [[customer-acme-secondary]]: …
- …

### Stale (3)
- [[product-payments]] last updated 2024-12-01; superseded by [[2025-payments-spec-v2]]
- …

### Orphans (5)
- [[concept-nav-facility]]: no inbound links — propose adding from [[product-payments]], [[customer-greenstreet]]
- …

### Missing Cross-Refs (4)
- [[customer-greenstreet]] uses Payments but doesn't link to [[product-payments]]
- …

### Terminology Drift (2)
- "subscription doc" vs. "subscription document" — glossary canonical is "subscription document"
- …

### Confidence Upgrades (2)
- [[product-lp-portal]]: low → medium (3 supporting sources now)
- …
```

After approval and application:
- Update [`../contradictions.md`](../contradictions.md) — opened, closed, status changes.
- Update [`../sourcing-queue.md`](../sourcing-queue.md) — gaps that closed, new gaps surfaced.
- Run `python ../../../commands/rebuild_referenced_by.py` from the repo root.
- Log it.
